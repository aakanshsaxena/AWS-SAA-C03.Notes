>## Key Insights and Information from Auto Scaling Group Lifecycle Hooks Transcript:
>
>**What are Lifecycle Hooks?**
>
>*  Lifecycle hooks are a powerful feature in AWS Auto Scaling Groups that allow you to define custom actions during instance launch and termination transitions.
>*  They give you control over the lifecycle of EC2 instances within an auto scaling group, enabling actions beyond the standard provisioning and termination processes.
>
>**How do they work?**
>
>*  Lifecycle hooks pause the instance launch or termination process at specific points.
>*  This pause allows you to perform custom actions, such as:
>    * Loading or indexing data during instance launch.
>    * Backing up data or logs before instance termination.
>*  You can either:
>    *  Wait for a configurable timeout (default 3600 seconds) for the process to continue.
>    *  Explicitly resume the process using the `Complete Lifecycle Action` operation.
>
>**Integration with EventBridge and SNS:**
>
>*  Lifecycle hooks can be integrated with EventBridge and SNS for event-driven processing.
>*  This allows your systems to react to instance launch and termination events, triggering automated workflows or notifications.
>
>**Visual Example:**
>
>*  The transcript provides a visual example of how lifecycle hooks work during instance launch and termination transitions.
>*  It illustrates the additional "wait" and "proceed" states introduced by lifecycle hooks, allowing time for custom actions.
>
>**Benefits:**
>
>*  **Customization:** Perform specific tasks during instance lifecycle events.
>* **Control:** Influence the instance provisioning and termination process.
>* **Automation:** Integrate with event-driven systems for automated workflows.

>This transcript provides a comprehensive overview of AWS Auto Scaling Group Lifecycle Hooks, highlighting their functionality, benefits, and integration possibilities.

- Custom actions on instances during ASG actions (instance launch or terminate transitions)
- Instances are paused within the flow, they wait for either a timeout (normally 3600 seconds, will either continue or abandon after), or you resume the ASG process CompleteLifecycleAction
- Eventbridge or SNS notifications
Architecture
- Let's say we want to change something about the instances when scaling out, we could use a lifecycle hook so the instance goes from pending to -> pending: wait (instead of straight to inservice), and it will wait until timeout or CompleteLifecycleAction (we make changes), to go into service
- With scaling in, instead of the instance going straight from terminating to terminated, it will first go to terminating wait and then same steps as above just terminating instead of starting
