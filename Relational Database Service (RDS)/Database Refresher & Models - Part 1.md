>## Key Insights and Information from the Database Fundamentals Lesson:
>
>**1. Database Systems:**
>
>* Store and manage data.
>* Broadly categorized into relational and non-relational (NoSQL).
>
>**2. Relational Databases (SQL):**
>
>* **Structure:** Data organized into tables with fixed schemas (defined beforehand).
>* **Schema:** Defines table structure, including column names, data types, and relationships.
>* **Relationships:** Fixed and predefined between tables, often using a joint table with composite keys.
>* **Example:** Pet database with tables for humans, animals, and a joint table linking them.
>* **Strengths:** Well-suited for structured data with consistent relationships.
>* **Weaknesses:** Less flexible for rapidly changing relationships.
>
>**3. NoSQL Databases:**
>
>* **Definition:** Any database system that is not relational.
>* **Characteristics:**
>    * Relaxed schema (weak or no schemas).
>    * Different relationship handling compared to SQL.
>* **Variety:** Encompasses many different database models.
>* **Strengths:** More flexible for evolving data structures and relationships.
>* **Weaknesses:** Can be more complex to understand and manage.
>
>**4. Key Concepts:**
>
>* **Table:** Fundamental unit of data storage in a relational database.
>* **Column (Attribute):** Defines a specific data field in a table.
>* **Row (Record):** Represents a single instance of data in a table.
>* **Primary Key:** Unique identifier for each row in a table.
>* **Composite Key:** A key formed by combining two or more attributes.
>* **Schema:** Defines the structure of a database, including tables, columns, and relationships.
>
>**5. Further Learning:**
>
>* The transcript suggests additional reading material for those who want to learn more about databases in general.
>
>
>This summary provides a concise overview of the key takeaways from the database fundamentals lesson.

- Relational (SQL) and Non-Relational (NoSQL)
	- Structured Query Language = SQL
- Structure in and between tables of data - rigid schema
- Relationships between tables
- NoSQL - not one single thing, just not SQL
- Generally a more relaxed schema and relationships are handled differently
- SQL
	- Have attributes, rows, and each row has a unique primary key value
	- Table schemas and relationships defined in advance
	- Table relationships use keys
