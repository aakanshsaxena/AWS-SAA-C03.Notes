- Function as a Service (FaaS) - short running & focused
- Lambda function is a piece of code lambda runs
- Functions use a runtime (e.g. Python 3.8)
- Functions are loaded and run in a runtime environment
- The environment has a direct memory (indirect CPU) allocation
- You are billed for the duration that a function runs
- Key part of a serverless architecture
- Common Runtimes: Python, Ruby, Java, Go, C#
- We upload a dev package to Lambda which then executes the code when invoked in its runtime environment, using execution roles (like IAM Roles but for Lambda functions)
- There is a 900s/15m function timeout for Lambda functions
- Common run times like Rust are available to use through layers
