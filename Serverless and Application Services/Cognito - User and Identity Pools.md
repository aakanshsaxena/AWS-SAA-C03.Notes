>## Key Insights and Information from the Amazon Cognito Lesson:
>
>**Cognito's Core Functionality:**
>
>* **Authentication, Authorization, and User Management:** Cognito provides these core functionalities for web and mobile applications.
>* **Two Main Components:**
>    * **User Pools:** Manage user sign-up, sign-in, and profile information. 
>        * Support both internal and social logins (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, SAML).
>        * Issue JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication with applications and API Gateway.
>        * **Important:** JWTs cannot be used to access AWS resources directly.
>    * **Identity Pools:** Exchange external identity tokens (like JWTs from user pools or social providers) for temporary AWS credentials.
>        * Allow access to AWS resources for authenticated and unauthenticated identities.
>        * Work with IAM roles to define permissions.
>
>**Understanding the Difference:**
>
>* **User Pools:** Focus on user management and providing a unified sign-in experience.
>* **Identity Pools:** Focus on securely granting temporary access to AWS resources based on external identities.
>
>**Key Concepts:**
>
>* **JWT (JSON Web Token):** A token issued by user pools that proves user authentication.
>* **Web Identity Federation:** The process of exchanging an external identity token for temporary AWS credentials via identity pools.
>* **IAM Roles:** Define permissions for accessing AWS resources.
>
>**Architecture Overviews:**
>
>* **User Pools Only:** Users sign in with user pools, receive JWTs, and use them to authenticate with self-managed resources or API Gateway.
>* **Identity Pools Only:** Users sign in with external providers, receive tokens, which are exchanged for temporary AWS credentials via identity pools.
>* **Combined User Pools and Identity Pools:** User pools handle sign-in and social identity management, while identity pools exchange the resulting JWTs for AWS credentials.
>
>**Important Notes:**
>
>* Applications should not store AWS credentials permanently.
>* Cognito simplifies the process of securely managing user identities and granting access to AWS resources.
>
>
>This summary provides a concise overview of the key insights and information presented in the Amazon Cognito lesson.

>## Key Insights and Information from the Transcript:
>
>**User Pools:**
>
>* Manage user signup and signin, both internal and social logins.
>* Abstract away the complexity of managing multiple external ID providers.
>* Generate a single type of token, the User Pool token (JWT), regardless of login method.
>* Simplify user identity management with a single user store.
>
>**Identity Pools:**
>
>* Exchange external identity tokens (e.g., Google, Facebook, User Pool tokens) for temporary AWS credentials.
>* This process is called federation.
>* Can be configured with a single external ID provider (e.g., User Pool).
>* Enable access to AWS resources for applications.
>* Support a near-unlimited number of users, exceeding the 5,000 IAM user limit.
>
>**Combined Architecture:**
>
>* User pools handle user authentication and generate User Pool tokens.
>* Applications pass User Pool tokens to identity pools.
>* Identity pools use the tokens to generate temporary AWS credentials.
>* Applications use these credentials to access AWS resources.
>
>**Benefits:**
>
>* Simplified user management with a single user store.
>* Reduced administrative overhead by using a single external ID provider for identity pools.
>* Scalability to handle a large number of users.
>
>**Next Steps:**
>
>* The AdFast demo will provide hands-on experience with identity pools.
>
>
>**Overall:** This architecture provides a robust and scalable solution for managing user authentication and access to AWS resources.

- Used for authentication, authorization, and user management for web/mobile apps
- User Pools are used for sign-in and to get JSON Web Token (JWT)
	- User directory management and profiles, sign up and sign in (customizable web UI), MFA and other security features
- Identity Pools allow you to offer access to temporary AWS credentials
	- This can either be unauthenticated identities (guest users), or federated identities (we can swap Google, FB, Twitter, SAML2.0, User Pool for short term AWS credentials to access AWS resources)
