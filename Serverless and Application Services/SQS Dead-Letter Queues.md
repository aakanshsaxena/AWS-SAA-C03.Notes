>## Key Insights from the Dead Letter Queues Lesson:
>
>**What are Dead Letter Queues (DLQs)?**
>
>* DLQs are a feature of Amazon SQS designed to handle messages that repeatedly fail processing in a regular queue.
>* They act as a safety net, preventing problematic messages from endlessly recirculating in the main queue.
>
>**How DLQs Work:**
>
>* Each message in an SQS queue has a "receive count" that increments every time it's received.
>* A "redrive policy" can be configured for a queue, specifying a "max receive count" threshold.
>* If a message exceeds the max receive count and hasn't been explicitly deleted, it's moved to the designated DLQ.
>
>**Benefits of Using DLQs:**
>
>* **Error Detection and Notification:** Configure alarms to be triggered when messages are delivered to the DLQ, alerting you to potential issues.
>* **Isolated Diagnostics:** Examine logs and message contents within the DLQ to pinpoint the cause of repeated processing failures.
>* **Specialized Processing:** Implement tailored processing logic for messages in the DLQ, such as retries, escalation, or manual review.
>
>**Important Considerations:**
>
>* **Retention Periods:**  All SQS queues have retention periods. When a message is moved to a DLQ, its original "Enqueue Time" (NQ timestamp) is retained, not the time of transfer.
>* **Dead Letter Queue Retention:**  Set the retention period of the DLQ longer than the source queue to ensure messages don't expire prematurely.
>* **Multiple Source Queues:** A single DLQ can be used for multiple source queues, providing centralized handling of problematic messages.
>
>**Overall, DLQs are a valuable tool for building robust and reliable message processing systems in AWS.** They provide mechanisms for error handling, diagnostics, and specialized processing, contributing to a more resilient and manageable architecture.

- In a normal queue, we count the message as being received when processing fail and have a corresponding count called ReceiveCount for this.
- We have a redrive policy which specifies the source queue, the dead-letter queue and the conditions where messages will be moved from one to the other. We also define maxReceiveCount here.
- When ReceiveCount > maxReceiveCount and the message isn't deleted, it's moved to the dead-letter queue.
- When this happens we move the message into the dead-letter queue so that we can further analyze where the issue lies with the message/processing.
- Keep in mind though, there is a retention period for SQS messages and the enqueue timestamp of message is unchanged when it goes into the dead-letter queue.
- However, the retention period of a dead-letter queue is generally longer than the source queues (to allow for debugging, problem handling, etc.)
