>
>**Problem:** Lambda functions have a 15-minute execution limit and are stateless, making them unsuitable for long-running workflows with complex logic and state management.
>
>**Solution:** AWS Step Functions provide a serverless way to define and execute long-running workflows (state machines) with state persistence.
>
>**Benefits of Step Functions:**
>
>* **Handles long-running workflows:** Can execute for up to 1 hour.
>* **State persistence:** Maintains state between steps, eliminating the need for complex Lambda chaining.
>* **Visual workflow design:**  Uses a visual interface to design and manage state machines.
>* **Integration with other AWS services:** Can integrate with Lambda, API Gateway, SQS, SNS, and many more.
>* **Flexible state management:** Offers various state types like wait, choice, parallel, and task states.
>* **Scalability and reliability:** Built on AWS infrastructure, ensuring scalability and reliability.
>
>**Types of Step Functions Workflows:**
>
>* **Standard:** Default workflow type with a 1-hour execution limit.
>* **Express:** Designed for high-volume, event-driven workloads with a 5-minute execution limit.
>
>**State Machine Example: "Whiskers' Cuddle-a-tron"**
>
>* **Scenario:** A cat named Whiskers needs reminders to be cuddled.
>* **Workflow:**
>    * **Timer state:** Waits for a predefined cuddle interval.
>    * **Choice state:** Determines the notification method based on various factors.
>    * **Task states:** Executes Lambda functions for email or SMS reminders.
>
>**Architecture:**
>
>* **Frontend:**  Web application hosted on S3.
>* **Backend:** Step Functions state machine orchestrates the workflow.
>* **Services:** Lambda functions for sending reminders, Simple Email Service, and SMS service.
>
>**Overall:**
>
>The transcript highlights the need for a solution like Step Functions to manage long-running, stateful workflows in a serverless environment. It provides a clear explanation of Step Functions' capabilities, benefits, and usage through a relatable example.

State Machines
- Serverless workflow (start -> states -> end)
- States are things which occur
- Maximum duration 1 year
- Standard workflow and Express workflow
- Started via API Gateway, IOT Rules, EventBridge, Lambda
- Amazon States Language (ASL) - JSON Template
- IAM Role is used for permissions
States
- SUCCEED & FAIL
- WAIT
- CHOICE
- PARALLEL
- MAP
- TASK (Lambda, Batch, DynamoDB, ECS, SNS, SQS, Glue, SageMaker, EMR, Step Functions)

>## Key Insights and Information from the Transcript:
>
>**Core Functionality:**
>
>* The system allows users to set reminders via a web application hosted on S3.
>* Users input the desired delay (in seconds), a custom message, and their preferred notification method (email, SMS, or both).
>* Clicking a button triggers a state machine execution.
>
>**Architecture:**
>
>* **Client-side:** A web application (HTML, JavaScript) hosted on S3.
>* **API Gateway:** Acts as the entry point for user requests, routing them to the Lambda function.
>* **Lambda Function:** 
>    * Processes user input from the web application.
>    * Triggers the state machine.
>    * Handles communication between the web app and the state machine.
>* **State Machine:** 
>    * A long-running workflow orchestrated by AWS Step Functions.
>    * Contains states representing decision points and tasks.
>    * Executes based on user input and triggers notifications (email or SMS) based on the selected method.
>
>**Workflow:**
>
>1. User interacts with the web application on S3, providing reminder details.
>2. User clicks a button to initiate the process.
>3. The API Gateway receives the request and invokes the Lambda function.
>4. The Lambda function passes user input to the state machine.
>5. The state machine waits for the specified duration.
>6. Based on user preferences, the state machine triggers either email or SMS notifications.
>
>**Benefits:**
>
>* **Serverless:** Utilizes AWS services like Lambda and Step Functions, eliminating infrastructure management.
>* **Scalable:** Can handle a large number of reminders without manual scaling.
>* **Flexible:** Supports various notification methods and can be easily extended with additional features.
>
>**Target Audience:**
>
>* Individuals interested in learning about serverless architectures and AWS Step Functions.
>* Developers looking to build robust and scalable reminder systems.
