>**CloudWatch Events vs. EventsBridge:**
>
>* **EventsBridge is the successor to CloudWatch Events.** It offers the same functionality as CloudWatch Events but with expanded capabilities.
>* **EventsBridge can handle events from third-party sources and custom applications**, while CloudWatch Events is limited to AWS services.
>* **AWS recommends using EventsBridge for new deployments**, although existing CloudWatch Events setups will still function.
>
>**Core Concepts:**
>
>* **Event Bus:** A stream of events generated by supported AWS services within an account.
>    * CloudWatch Events has a single, implicit event bus.
>    * EventsBridge allows creating multiple event buses for specific applications or third-party services.
>* **Rules:** Define how to react to events based on patterns or scheduled times.
>    * **Pattern Matching Rules:** Triggered when an event matches a predefined pattern.
>    * **Scheduled Rules:** Triggered based on a CRON expression, similar to Unix cron jobs.
>* **Targets:**  Destinations where events are delivered when a rule is triggered. Examples include Lambda functions.
>
>**Event Structure:**
>
>* Events are JSON objects containing data about the event, such as the source, type, and timestamp.
>* Targets can use this data to perform actions based on the event.
>
>**Use Cases:**
>
>* **Monitoring and Alerting:** React to changes in AWS services (e.g., instance state changes) and trigger alerts.
>* **Automation:** Trigger automated tasks based on events (e.g., start a Lambda function when a new file is uploaded).
>* **Orchestration:** Coordinate workflows across different services by chaining events and rules.
>
>**Key Takeaways:**
>
>* EventsBridge is the recommended service for managing events in AWS.
>* It provides a flexible and powerful way to react to events and automate tasks.
>* Understanding event buses, rules, and targets is essential for leveraging the full potential of EventsBridge.

Key Concepts
- If X happens, or at Y times -> do Z
- EventBridge is kind of CloudWatch Events v2
- There is a default event bus for the account, in CloudWatch Events this is the only bus
- In EventBridge, you can have additional event busses for other services or third party services
- Rules match incoming events or schedules
- Route the events to 1+ targets like Lambda
- Events are really just JSON files, so the event bus has a constant flow of events of services, EventBridge/CloudWatch Events see this and recognize if it matches an event pattern rule/schedule rule and then route the events to the target.
