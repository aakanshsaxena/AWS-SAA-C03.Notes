- Special type of IAM Role
	- IAM Role linked to a specific AWS service
	- Provide a set of permissions that is predefined by a service
	- Providing permissions that a service needs to interact with other AWS services on your behalf
	- Service might create/delete the role, or allow you to during the setup or within IAM
	- Key difference is that you can't delete the role until it's no longer required 
- Role separation = giving one group of people the ability to create roles and another group of people the ability to use them
- Pass-role permission = use preexisting role with a service but not create or edit the role
- By default when you create a CloudFormation stack, CloudFormation uses the permissions of your identity to interact with AWS
