- CloudTrail is a regional service
- A trail logs events for the AWS region that it is configured in, either one region or all regions
- Organizational trail is another type - a CloudTrail trail created by the management account of an organization can store all the information for all the accounts within the organization
- All region trail is a collection of one region trails

Exam Tips
- CloudTrail is enabled by default with 90 day history
- Trails are how you configure S3 and CWLogs
- Management events are the only ones logged by default
- IAM, STS, CloudFront = Global Service Events, and must be enabled if you want to log these. They also log to US-East-1
- CloudTrail is not the product if you want real-time logging, there is a delay
