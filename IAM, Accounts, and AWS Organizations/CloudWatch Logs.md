- CW Logs are a public service = usable from AWS or on-premises
- Store, monitor, and access logging data
- Built in integrations with other AWS services
- We can log products and services outside of AWS by using a CloudWatch agent
- Can generate metrics based on logs - metric filter
- Regional service
- Log streams = log events from the same source
- Log groups = containers for multiple log streams
	- For example, we have VAR logs (default Linux Logs) for 3 EC2 instances,
	- Each EC2 instance gets its own log streams, and we can create a log group for the three
- We store configuration settings on the log group -> applies to all log streams within the group
- We also define metric filters on the log groups
