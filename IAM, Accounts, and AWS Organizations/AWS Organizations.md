- Allows larger businesses to manage multiple AWS accounts
- Take a single standard AWS account (standard AWS account = an AWS account not in an organization)
	- Create an AWS organization with a standard AWS account, organization is not created within the AWS account.
	- The account that you created the organization with becomes the Management Account (/Master account) for the Organization 
	- Invite other standard AWS accounts using your management account, when they accept they are part of being your organization
	- This means they go from being a standard account to a member account
	- Organizations only have one management account
- You can create a structure within an AWS organization (hierarchical)
- Service Control Policies (SCPs) let you control what AWS accounts within the organization can do
- Organizations change some best practices
	- For example, we don't need to create IAM users within each AWS account
	- Instead, we can use IAM roles to allow IAM users to access other AWS accounts
