>## Key Insights and Information from EC2 Optimization Lesson:
>
>**1. Enhanced Networking (SRIOV):**
>
>* **Purpose:** Improves EC2 networking performance, essential for high-performance features like cluster placement groups.
>* **How it works:**  
>    * Traditional: Each instance shares a single physical network interface card (NIC) controlled by the host, leading to slower performance and CPU overhead.
>    * Enhanced: Each instance gets exclusive access to a logical NIC on the physical card, eliminating host involvement and improving speed and efficiency.
>* **Benefits:**
>    * Higher I/O across all instances.
>    * Lower host CPU usage.
>    * Increased bandwidth and faster networking speeds.
>    * Higher packets per second (PPS) for applications handling many small packets.
>    * Low and consistent latency.
>* **Availability:** Enabled by default or free on most modern EC2 instance types.
>
>**2. EBS-Optimized Instances:**
>
>* **Purpose:** Improves performance of EBS block storage by dedicating network capacity for storage traffic.
>* **How it works:**  
>    * Traditional: Shared network stack for data and EBS storage, leading to contention and performance limitations.
>    * EBS-Optimized: Dedicated network capacity for EBS, ensuring faster storage speeds and preventing data network interference.
>* **Benefits:**
>    * Faster EBS speeds.
>    * Improved throughput and IOPS, especially with GD2 and IO1 volume types.
>    * Low and consistent latency for storage operations.
>* **Availability:** Enabled by default and free on most modern instance types.
>
>**3. Key Takeaways for Solutions Architects:**
>
>* Understand the benefits of both features for optimizing EC2 performance.
>*  Know how they work at a high level to make informed decisions about instance types and configurations.
>*  Leverage these features to improve application performance and scalability.
