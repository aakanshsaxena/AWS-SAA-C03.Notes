>## Key Insights and Information from the EC2 Instance Types Transcript:
>
>**1. EC2 Instance Types: The Foundation of Your AWS Infrastructure**
>
>* EC2 instances are virtual servers with customizable resource configurations (CPU, memory, storage, etc.).
>* Choosing the right instance type is crucial for performance and cost optimization.
>* Understanding instance types empowers you to make informed decisions based on your workload needs.
>
>**2. Factors Influencing Instance Type Selection:**
>
>* **Resource Allocation:** Raw CPU, memory, storage capacity, and type.
>* **Resource Ratios:**  Some instances prioritize CPU, others memory, depending on the workload.
>* **Cost:** Instance types have varying costs per minute based on their resources.
>* **Network Bandwidth:** Storage and data networking capabilities differ between instance types.
>* **Hardware Architecture:** Instances can run on ARM or x86 architectures with different CPU vendors (Intel, AMD).
>* **Additional Capabilities:** Some instances offer GPUs, FPGAs, or other specialized hardware.
>
>**3. Five Main Instance Categories:**
>
>* **General Purpose:** Default choice for steady-state workloads with balanced resource ratios.
>* **Compute Optimized:** Ideal for CPU-intensive tasks like media processing, HPC, and gaming.
>* **Memory Optimized:** Designed for applications requiring large memory allocations, like in-memory caching and databases.
>* **Accelerated Computing:**  Provides dedicated GPUs or FPGAs for high-performance computing and specialized workloads.
>* **Storage Optimized:**  Offers high-performance local storage for sequential and random I/O-intensive applications.
>
>**4. Decoding EC2 Instance Type Names:**
>
>* **Family:**  Letter designation (e.g., R, M, T) indicating the instance type category.
>* **Generation:** Number indicating the iteration of the instance family (e.g., R5, C4).
>* **Size:**  Size designation (e.g., 8X large) indicating the amount of CPU and memory allocated.
>* **Additional Capabilities:**  Letters (e.g., a, d, n, e) representing specific features.
>
>**5. Key Takeaways:**
>
>* Understand the strengths and weaknesses of different instance types.
>*  Prioritize the most recent generation for optimal price-to-performance.
>*  Scale systems efficiently by using a larger number of smaller instances.
>*  Familiarize yourself with common instance type

EC2 Instance Types
- Raw CPU, Memory, Local Storage Capacity & Type
- Resource Ratios (How much CPU compared to RAM, etc.)
- Storage and Data Network Bandwidth
- System Architecture/Vendor
- Additional Features and Capabilities
EC2 Categories
- General Purpose - Default - Diverse workloads, equal resource ratio
- Compute Optimized - Media Processing, HPC, Scientific Modeling, Gaming, ML
- Memory Optimized - Processing large in-memory datasets, some database workloads
- Accelerated Computing - Hardware GPU, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)
- Storage Optimized - Sequential and Random IO - scale-out transactional DB, data warehousing, Elasticsearch, analytics workloads
Decoding EC2 Types
- We'll use R5dn.8xlarge as an example
- R = Instance Family
- 5 = Instance Generation (within family)
- d/n = slots for additional capabilities (MIGHT not always exist. a = AMD processor,  d = NVMe storage, g = graviton processors, n = enhanced network capabilities, z = high frequency processing)
- 8xlarge = Instance Size (Nano, Micro, Small, Medium, Large, XLarge, 2XLarge, ...)
