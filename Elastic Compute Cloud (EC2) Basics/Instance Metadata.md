>## Key Insights and Information from the EC2 Instance Metadata Transcript:
>
>**What is Instance Metadata?**
>
>* It's a service provided by EC2 that gives instances information about themselves and their environment.
>* This information can be used to configure or manage running instances.
>* It's accessible to anything running inside the instance.
>
>**Accessing Instance Metadata:**
>
>* The IP address to access metadata is **169.254.169.254**. 
>* This is a fixed IP address for all EC2 instances.
>* The URL format is typically **http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/**
>
>**Types of Information Available:**
>
>* **Networking:** Public IP addresses, security groups, etc.
>* **System:** Hostname, instance ID, etc.
>* **Authentication:** Temporary credentials for assuming roles.
>* **User Data:** Scripts for automatic configuration.
>
>**Important Considerations:**
>
>* **No Authentication:** The metadata service has no authentication by default, meaning anyone with access to the instance's command line can access it.
>* **No Encryption:** Metadata is not encrypted by default.
>* **Security:**
>
>    * Treat metadata as potentially exposed.
>    * Consider using local firewall rules to restrict access to the metadata IP address.
>
>**Exam Relevance:**
>
>* Instance metadata is frequently featured in AWS exams.
>* Memorizing the IP address and URL structure is crucial.
>
>
>**Overall:**
>
>Instance metadata is a powerful but potentially insecure feature of EC2. Understanding its architecture and limitations is essential for effective use and security.

- EC2 Service provides data to instances
- Accessible inside all instances
- http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data
- Gives you access to variety of info about specific EC2 instance (environment, networking, authentication, security groups, user-data)
- Not authenticated or encrypted. Anyone who can access that instance can access it's metadata
