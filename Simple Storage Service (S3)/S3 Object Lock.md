- Automatically enabled on 'new' buckets
- Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) - No delete, no overwrite
- Requires versioning to be enabled - individual versions are locked
- Two types (should be thought about as seperate)
	- Retention Period
	- Legal Hold
- Can use none, one, or both
- Can either use object lock settings on specific objects or have a default setting for the whole bucket
Retention
- Specify a retention period (days and years)
- Compliance - can't be adjusted, deleted, or overwritten even by account root user until retention expires
	- **Make sure that this is the retention mode you intend because once you set you can't change it**
- Governance - special permissions can be granted allowing lock settings to be adjusted
- s3:BypassGovernanceRetention (allows you to bypass)
- x-amz-bypass-governance-retention:true (console default)
Legal Hold
- Either on or off with no retention
- No deletes or changes until removed
- s3:PutObjectLegalHold is required to add or remove
- Prevent accidental deletion of critical object versions (similar to Governance Retention without a time limit)
- Can use multiple modes together (ex. compliance with legal hold)
