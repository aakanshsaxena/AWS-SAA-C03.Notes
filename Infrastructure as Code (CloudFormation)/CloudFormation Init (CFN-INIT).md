> #### CloudFormation::Init vs. UserData
> - **Procedural vs. Desired State:** **User Data** is a simple, procedural script that runs sequentially on instance launch. It is often used for basic bootstrapping but can become complex and difficult to manage. **`CloudFormation::Init`**, on the other hand, is a powerful, desired-state configuration system.
> - **Idempotency:** A key advantage of `CloudFormation::Init` is that it is **idempotent**. It checks the current state of a resource against the desired state defined in the template. If a configuration is already met (e.g., a package is already installed), it will be skipped, which prevents unnecessary changes and simplifies updates.
> - **Cross-Platform:** `CloudFormation::Init` is a unified configuration tool that supports both Linux and Windows EC2 instances.
> #### Core Architecture and Process
> - **Configuration Location:** The `CloudFormation::Init` configuration is not in the `UserData` script itself. Instead, it is stored in the `Metadata` section of your EC2 logical resource within the CloudFormation template.
> - **Bootstrapping:** The **User Data** script is used to bootstrap the instance. It contains a minimal script that fetches the configuration and executes it. This script typically includes a call to the `cfn-init` helper script.
> - **The `cfn-init` Helper Script:** The `cfn-init` helper script is a tool that runs on the EC2 instance. It fetches the `CloudFormation::Init` configuration from the instance's metadata, using the stack ID, logical resource name, and region as parameters to identify the correct configuration. It then applies the specified directives.
> #### Configuration Structure
> The `CloudFormation::Init` metadata is a structured set of directives that define the desired state. These directives are organized into keys, which can be grouped into `ConfigSets`.
> - **Config Sets:** These are logical groupings of configuration keys. They define an ordered list of configurations to apply. This allows you to apply different configurations for different scenarios (e.g., `install_web_server` and `configure_app`).
> - **Configuration Keys:** These are the specific directives that `cfn-init` executes in a defined order:
>     - `packages`: Installs software packages using a package manager (e.g., `yum` on Linux).
>     - `groups`: Creates groups.
>     - `users`: Creates users.
>     - `sources`: Downloads and unpacks archives from URLs.
>     - `files`: Creates files on the instance with specified content, permissions, and ownership.
>     - `commands`: Runs shell commands. Commands are executed in alphabetical order by their logical ID.
>     - `services`: Configures and starts services (e.g., `httpd`).
> #### Benefits and Usage
> - **Simplified Management:** `CloudFormation::Init` separates the configuration logic from the bootstrapping script, which makes the `UserData` section cleaner and the configuration itself easier to read and maintain.
> - **Debugging:** `cfn-init` logs its output to a file (`/var/log/cfn-init.log`), which makes it much easier to debug configuration failures than a simple `UserData` script.
> - **In-place Updates:** When combined with the `cfn-hup` helper script, `CloudFormation::Init` can detect updates to a resource's metadata and apply new configurations to a running instance without the need for a full instance replacement.

- Another way to provide config information to an EC2 instance
- Simple configuration management system
- Configuration directives stored in template
- AWS::CloudFormation::Init part of logical resource
- Procedural - HOW (User Data) vs Desired State - WHAT (cfn-init)
- Idempotent, for example if we want cfn-init to install Apache, and Apache already installed, nothing happens (easier than creating script logic for user data)
- We use cfn-init helper script - installed on EC2 OS
