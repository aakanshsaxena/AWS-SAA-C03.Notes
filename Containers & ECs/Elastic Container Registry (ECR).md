>## Key Insights and Information from the Elastic Container Registry (ECR) Lesson:
>
>**What is ECR?**
>
>* A managed container image registry service provided by AWS.
>* Think of it as Docker Hub but for AWS.
>* Hosts and manages container images used in applications like ECS and KKS.
>
>**ECR Structure:**
>
>* Each AWS account gets one public and one private registry.
>* Registries contain multiple repositories (like Git repos).
>* Repositories contain multiple container images with unique tags.
>
>**Security:**
>
>* **Public Registry:** Anyone can read, but write requires permissions.
>* **Private Registry:** Permissions required for both read and write operations.
>
>**Benefits of ECR:**
>
>* **Integration with IAM:**  Permissions are managed through AWS Identity and Access Management.
>* **Security Scanning:**
>    * **Basic:** Standard security checks.
>    * **Enhanced:** Uses AWS Inspector for deeper analysis of OS and software packages on a layer-by-layer basis.
>* **Real-time Metrics:** Data on authentication, push/pull operations sent to CloudWatch.
>* **Logging:** All API actions logged in CloudTrail and events sent to EventBridge for event-driven workflows.
>* **Image Replication:** Container images can be replicated across regions and accounts.
>
>**Learning ECR:**
>
>* The best way to understand ECR is to use it.
>* The course will provide hands-on opportunities to push and pull container images.
>
>
>**Overall:** ECR is a powerful and secure service for managing container images within the AWS ecosystem. Its integration with other AWS services and robust security features make it a valuable tool for developers and DevOps teams.

- Managed container image registry service for AWS (like Docker Hub)
- Each AWS account has public and private registry. 
- Each registry can have many repositories, each repository can contain many images
- Images can have several tags
- Public Registry = anyone can have read only access, permissions needed for read-write
- Private = permissions required for any operations
- Integrated with IAM for permissions
- Image scanning
	- Basic
	- Enhanced (uses Inspector) - newer product scans for issues with both the OS and any software packages within your containers
- Near real-time metrics through CloudWatch -> auth, push, pull
- API Actions through CloudTrail, events through EventBridge
- Can replicate container images cross region and cross account
